## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

Localboard is an offline project management tool that was created to help circumvent web connection issues I was facing at college. This project allows for the user to create multiple kanban boards, attach descriptions and dates to each task, and to view the tasks in a calendar.

Expand each task to add description or date attributes and modify the initial content. You can drag and drop columns, or tasks.
